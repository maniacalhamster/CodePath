## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Issue came up when I tried to test the app on my galaxy phone. Downloaded ADB
drivers off the samsung site and updated drivers on device manager and with
Windows Update but Android Studio still didn't recognize my phone. I ended up
resolving this by Revoking all Debug Authorization on my phone and gave the 
Authorization again when I reconnected the USB.
